                            <span>Background:&nbsp;</span>mc-dma is the official website for the Moorpark 
                            College Graphic and Multimedia Design Program. The main purpose of the site is 
                            to serve as a student resource as well as to attract potential students to the 
                            program. My work on the website began as a paid internship under Professor Svetlana 
                            Kasalovic. My goals in undertaking the internship were to gain professional 
                            experience working under a talented project manager, prepare myself for taking 
                            on freelance clients, and improve my web design skills. My role was as the primary
                            front-end developer. I worked closely with a graphic design intern to recreate her 
                            design in a pixel-perfect, responsive manner. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>Features:&nbsp;</span>mc-dma is a Wordpress-based, multi-page static site. 
                            It features a homepage, a student work gallery, and several pages with pertinent 
                            information and resources for students. The site runs on Wordpress, allowing for 
                            school administrators to add future content without the help of a developer. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>Challenges:&nbsp;</span>mc-dma had many developers working on it before me,
                            so I had to learn how to jump into older codebases rather than starting fresh. This 
                            taught me to integrate the logical thought processes of people I had never met into
                            my problem solving skills. Another challenge I faced was conducting user testing in 
                            order to optimize the site. First, I developed and distributed surveys to current stuents
                            in the program to study what they wanted out of the site. I later conducted end-user 
                            testing through Hotjar and Google Analytic. This gave me insight into how clients 
                            actually used the site. I learned a great deal about UX during this process. Finally,
                            the greatest challenge that I faced was when the site was infected with malware. 
                            The previous developers had hosted several of the school's websites on a single server.
                            The infected site, which was not being maintained by a developer, then infected all the 
                            sites. I had to go through every PHP file and manually fix the problems. I also ensured 
                            that each site had anti-malware protection going forward. The process taught me to 
                            never go into an existing project assuming that the previous developers had secured it.

                            <span>Background:&nbsp;</span>VXX Journeys began in 2018 during a Python independent study conducted 
                            under Professor Nikjeh at Moorpark College. My goals with the project were to become competent in Django 
                            as well to build something that brought value to my organization that I would update, maintain, and use 
                            for years to come. The main purpose of the webapp is to document my non-profit organization's bicycle 
                            expeditions through Vietnam, a country that I lived in on and off from 2010 through 2020 first as a teacher 
                            and then as a freelance programming tutor. Recently, I overhauled the webapp to be responsive, 
                            I refactored or removed bad code, and I added routes from our most recent bicycle trip in 2020. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>Features:&nbsp;</span>VXX Journeys has two main features. First, it contains filterable Instagram 
                            posts plotted onto a map of Vietnam. It achieves this by using Python to query the Instagram API for new posts 
                            from the VXX Instagram account and the Leaflet.js library for plotting the images on the map. Second, 
                            it allows users to select an individual day from a journey to have the route plotted onto the map. The GPS 
                            data is passed asynchronously from the server to the client on demand. An admin dashboard is used to 
                            upload new GPS routes for individual ride days as well as to edit any erroneous data pulled from Instagram. 
                            The webapp is fully responsive. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>Challenges:&nbsp;</span>Throughout the project, there were several noteworthy challenges I faced which turned 
                            me into a better developer. When I began back in 2018, I knew very little about database design. Learning 
                            my way around the Django ORM taught me to think about data through the lens of object-oriented programming. I've since 
                            become much more competent in database design and management. While revamping VXX Journeys this year, 
                            I had to convert the database from SQL to Postgres in order to host the site on Heroku. Through this process I 
                            learned the nuts and bolts of exporting and loading data from DBMS. Another challenge I faced was the ever-mutating 
                            Instagram API. The webapp originally logged in to my account using the Instaloader Python package in order to 
                            download posts. However, when ran from a server, this triggered a suspicious login attempt check. To bypass this, 
                            I wrote a Selenium script to retrieve the Instagram security code from my Gmail account. However, the API had 
                            several limitations such as how it structured its data and what permissions it required to access certain metadata. 
                            Furthermore, the image URLs that I would pass to the front-end to be displayed on the map expired after only a few 
                            days requiring the script to continuously check for dead links and redownload post metadata. Simply put, it was 
                            over-engineered. While the system I built ensured data confidentiality and integrity, I decided that relying on a 
                            third party for availability was unacceptable. In order to ensure the long-term stability of the webapp, I decided 
                            to refactor my script to download and store Instagram posts locally. Now I can be positive the webapp will always 
                            function as intended. This project taught me so much about coding using web frameworks. While I'm not partial to 
                            Django specifically, I certainly appreciate the power and speed that comes from leveraging it to quickly prototype 
                            project ideas such as VXX Journeys.

                                    <span>Challenges:&nbsp;</span>The challenges with this project all stem from the archaic web builder environment provided by the client's host, web.com. The client did not have the resources fund a migration to another service. One challenge I overcame was when the client requested a student portal that would be hidden behind an access code. Since the web builder provided no such functionality, I solved the problem by adding onlick JavaScript code to a button which prompted users for their access code before redirecting them to a hidden student resources page. This was not a perfect solution, but it met the needs of the client while remaining within budget.
